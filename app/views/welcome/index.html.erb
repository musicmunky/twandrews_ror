			<p>Who am I?  I'm a programmer...a web developer...a software engineer.  I've had various titles during my career, but the main idea is that
				I love to build things.  Web apps, mobile apps, monolithic, distributed, simple, complex, MVC, Agile, whatever - as long as I'm creating I'm happy.
				Writing code is an outlet - a medium for expressing myself creatively, while at the same time providing a platform on which to build things
				that people might find useful or interesting.
				My code is not always pretty.  To be honest, sometimes my code looks like someone threw a "Dummies Guide to Javascript" into a blender and
				then pasted the results into a crossword puzzle.
				Okay that might be a <i>bit</i> of hyperbole, but you get the idea.</p>
			<p>At the end of the day it comes down to a love of creating - a love of making.  If I had a garage I'd be a mechanic, and if I had the
				dexterity and tools necessary I'd probably be a carpenter.  Sadly my toolset is mostly virtual, and my garage space is nonexistent, but if
				I'm building something it's all the same to me.
				Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments, or if you an interesting job opportunity.</p>
			<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
